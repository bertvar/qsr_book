Frequency tables can be produced in R using the function table() which can report both raw counts and percentages depending on how we specify the code.\nWe begin by describing the univariate distribution as raw counts of respondents for each category of the variable tv.\n\ntable(omni$tv)\n\n\nNecessary Desirable \n     1013       892 \n\n\nThe table shows that 1013 respondents say that having a TV is a necessity whereas 892 answer that it is simply desirable.\nBased on manipulating these raw counts we can calculate other quantities. In order to manipulate this table we need to store it in memory and give it a name, in this case tabtv\n\n# We create an object call tabtv that contains the distribution of variable \"tv\" in the dataset omni\ntabtv &lt;- table(omni$tv)\n\n# We ask R to display the new object \"tabtv\"\ntabtv\n\n\nNecessary Desirable \n     1013       892 \n\n\nThe first thing we can do is to add margins to the tabtv table - i.e. the sum of all observations contained in your table - using the function addmargins()\n\naddmargins(tabtv)\n\n\nNecessary Desirable       Sum \n     1013       892      1905 \n\n\nWe can also express the numbers in the table as proportions or percentages\n\n# as proportion\nprop.table(tabtv)\n\n\nNecessary Desirable \n0.5317585 0.4682415 \n\n#as percentage\nprop.table(tabtv)*100\n\n\nNecessary Desirable \n 53.17585  46.82415 \n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Tidyverse\nYou can produce the same results using tidyverse functions. The tidyverse is a family of packages that have consistent coding principles and data handling conventions. For a detailed treatment of the tidyverse see the book R for Data Science (2nd Edition) by Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel and Grolemund.\nA key element of the tidyverse is the use of the pipe operator |&gt; (hotkey: command/ctrl + shift + m) which allow us to write sequences or chains of functions - a bit like a baking recipe as shown in figure 1.\n\n\n\nPiping in R (@ArthurWelle)\n\n\nHere’s an example of how we create a frequency table in R using tidyverse functions or verbs and the pipe operator:\n\nomni |&gt; # dataset \n  drop_na(tv) |&gt; # drop missing values from variable tv\n  group_by(tv) |&gt; # across the response categories\n  summarise(n = n()) |&gt; # count the respondents\n  mutate(perc = n / sum(n) * 100) |&gt; \n  kable() # render nice looking table\n\n\n\n\ntv\nn\nperc\n\n\n\n\nNecessary\n1013\n53.17585\n\n\nDesirable\n892\n46.82415\n\n\n\n\n\nor using the function count()\n\nomni |&gt; # dataset\n  drop_na(tv) |&gt; # drop missing values from variable tv\n  count(tv) |&gt; # count the respondents in each category\n  mutate(perc = n / sum(n) * 100) |&gt; \n  kable() # render nice looking table\n\n\n\n\ntv\nn\nperc\n\n\n\n\nNecessary\n1013\n53.17585\n\n\nDesirable\n892\n46.82415\n\n\n\n\n\nTo round percentages up to 2 digits you can use the round() function\n\nomni |&gt; # dataset\n  drop_na(tv) |&gt; # drop missing values from variable tv\n  count(tv) |&gt; # count the respondents in each category\n  mutate(perc = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2)) |&gt; # calculate percentage\n  kable() # render nice looking table\n\n\n\n\ntv\nn\nperc\n\n\n\n\nNecessary\n1013\n53.18\n\n\nDesirable\n892\n46.82\n\n\n\n\n\nOr you can use the function percent from the package scales which will also add the % sign\n\nomni |&gt; # dataset\n  drop_na(tv) |&gt; # drop missing values from variable tv\n  count(tv) |&gt; # count the respondents in each category\n  mutate(perc = percent(n / sum(n), 0.01)) |&gt; # calculate percentage\n  kable() # render nice looking table\n\n\n\n\ntv\nn\nperc\n\n\n\n\nNecessary\n1013\n53.18%\n\n\nDesirable\n892\n46.82%\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the tabyl function (from the janitor package) makes it quite easy to produce nice tables, which becomes particularly useful for contingency tables discussed further below.\n\nomni |&gt; \n  drop_na(tv) |&gt; \n  tabyl(tv) |&gt; # create frequency table\n  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) |&gt; # choose number of decimals\n  kable()\n\n\n\n\ntv\nn\npercent\n\n\n\n\nNecessary\n1013\n53.2%\n\n\nDesirable\n892\n46.8%",

    "text": "3.4 Graphical representation of univariate categorical data:\nWith ggplot we can create bar charts easily using the geom_bar option. The basic syntax is as follows:\n\n# Basic barplot\nggplot(data = omni, aes(x = tv)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that R ggplot creates a bar for the missing values (called NA). This NA bar draws away our attention from the Necessary and Desirable bars and could potentially distort the plot as a whole. We will remove the missing values by subsetting the data we input into the graph. To subset the data we use the following line when defining the data in ggplot: omni[!is.na(omni$tv), ]\n\n# Eliminate missing value category from the chart with (omni[!is.na(omni$tv), ]\nggplot(omni[!is.na(omni$tv), ], aes(x=tv)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively we can use the function complete.cases() which is a bit more readable and produces the same result:\n\n# Eliminate missing value category from the chart with (omni[complete.cases(omni$tv), ]\nggplot(omni[complete.cases(omni$tv), ], aes(x=tv)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOften you may want to plot proportions rather than counts, which can be achieved by changing the aesthetics’ options. In this case, after declaring the variables write a comma and add after_stat(prop), group = 1:\n\nggplot(data = omni[complete.cases(omni$tv), ], aes(x=tv, y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"count\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince percentages are basically proportions multiplied by 100, we can have percentages on our plot by re-scaling (changing the scale) of the vertical axis using the option scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\n# If you want proportions, you need to modify the aesthetics options for the y axis\n\nggplot(data = omni[complete.cases(omni$tv), ], \n       aes(x=tv, y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"count\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr using the tidyverse you can integrate the specification of the ggplot graphs as part of a wider sequence of functions applied to the same data:\n\nomni |&gt; \n  drop_na(tv) |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(aes( x = tv, y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we should change the labels in the plot and add a title to make it more informative\n\nomni |&gt; \n  drop_na(tv) |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(aes( x = tv, y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  xlab(\"Is a TV set necessary?\") + # change the x axis label\n  ylab(\"Percentage of respondents\") + # change the y axis label\n  ggtitle(\"A majority of respondents think a TV is necessary\") # change the main title of the graph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use specify labels and title within the function labs and produce the exact same results:\n\nomni |&gt; \n  drop_na(tv) |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(aes( x = tv, y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) +\n  labs(x = \"Is a TV set necessary?\", # specify x-axis lab\n       y = \"Percentage of respondents\", # specify y-axis lab\n       caption = \"Poverty and Social Exclusion Survey 2012\",\n       title = \"A majority of respondents think a TV is necessary\")  # main title",

Thus we may want to know:\n\nHow the distribution of perception of necessities varies between different economic positions.\nThe socioeconomic composition of those who think TVs are necessary compared to those that think TVs are only desirable goods.\n\nThe first seems to be a more plausible relation. It makes sense that we should care whether people with greater attachment to the labour market are more or less likely to consider TVs a necessity compared to those without.\nThe first bar plot we will create is a stacked bar chart.\n\n#stacked bar chart\nggplot(data = omni[complete.cases(omni$tv) & !is.na(omni$paidwork) ,] , \n       aes(x=paidwork)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"count\", aes(fill=tv)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we are interested in comparing the proportions within each group, particularly if there are large differences in raw counts, we can also stack them to add to 100%:\n\n#stacked bar chart up to 100%\nomni |&gt; \n  drop_na(tv, paidwork) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=paidwork)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"count\", aes(fill=tv), position=\"fill\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also build a clustered bar chart which we can create in two different ways.

It requires an additional package called ggstats for geom_bar() to recognise proportions as the quantity to plot\n\nomni |&gt; \n  drop_na(tv, paidwork) |&gt; \n  group_by (paidwork, tv) |&gt;\n  count() |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=paidwork, fill = tv, weight = n, \n              by = tv, y = after_stat(prop))) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"prop\", \n           position=\"dodge\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than clustering within the same graph, an alternative is to use faceting:\n\n# \"faceted\" clustered bar chart\nomni |&gt; \n  drop_na(tv, paidwork) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=tv)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"count\") + \n  facet_wrap(~paidwork)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we can obviously add labels and titles using the same functions as before.",
